 * Custom Meta-Data
 * Parameter support in step argument
 * Examples from external source (`CSV`, `XML`, `JSON`, `EXCEL`, `DB`) with filter options

### Using qaf-cucumber with QAF BDD runner
When you are using QAF BDD runner you can use Cucumber 5 steps with QAF BDD or BDD2 or Gherkin. 

##### Why QAF BDD runner
 * Native TestNG implemenatation (All features of testNG)
 * Multiple syntax support (QAF BDD, BDD2, Gherkin)
 * Step Meta-data support
 * Step retry support
 * Supports step defined in BDD (non Java steps)
 * Verification (also known as soft-assert) support
 * Detailed live reporting
 * TestNG Execution configuration
 
 Belwo is basic TestNG configuration:
 ```xml
 <suite name="QAF Demo" parallel="methods" verbose="0">
 <test name="QAF-BDD-Test">
   <parameter name="step.provider.pkg" value="pkg.to.look.for.steps" />
   <parameter name="scenario.file.loc" value="resources/features" />
   <classes>
      <class name="com.qmetry.qaf.automation.step.client.text.BDDTestFactory2" />
   </classes>
</test>
</suite>
```
 Refer [documentation](https://qmetry.github.io/qaf/latest/bdd-configuration.html) for more details.
